Hello and welcome to my website. I am a clinical-academic [orthoptist](https://www.orthoptics.org.uk/) troubled by improving children's eyesight, and how a child's poor eyesight affects the adult they become.

Current work and interests
======
Children that have [squint](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/squint/) have altered visual and social experience of growing up. Affected children:-
1. experience social isolation. For example, they may receive fewer invites to peers' birthday parties.
1. are excluded from some career opportunities
1. may have reduced hand-eye coordination and sporting ability, 
1. receive a variety of therapy, medical and surgical interventions

Adolescents that had squint in childhood are more likely to have a mental health condition such as depression, anxiety or schizophrenia. 

I am interested in why these adolescents have poorer mental health than their peers. Could it be related to the social or physical factors described above? Shared genetic factors? Or a complex process through associations  / interactions with third variable(s) such as neuro-divergent conditions (e.g. Autsism & ADHD).
